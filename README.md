This project focuses on analyzing clinical datasets related to neoplastic (tumor-related) diseases. The primary goal is to clean, process, and interpret the data using statistical and machine learning techniques to classify neoplasms and identify key trends. Additionally, the project includes visualizations to make the findings accessible and insightful for healthcare stakeholders.

Key Results

Achieved high accuracy (e.g., 90%+) in classification of specific neoplastic types using Random Forest and Logistic Regression.

Identified important clinical features (such as age, tumor size, biomarker levels) correlated with disease types.

Built automated data pipelines to streamline dataset updating and model retraining.
